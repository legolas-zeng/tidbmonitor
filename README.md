## Multi-host

```

More detail in [seagull-design-and-implement](docs/en/development/seagull-design-and-implement.md) and we have excellent documents in [docs](docs/).

## Notice

The [issue #2](https://github.com/tobegit3hub/seagull/issues/2) shows that everyone can access your docker daemon if the IP and port of seagull are exposed. For security, you can bind to localhost to restrict the access.

```
docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:10086:10086 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock tobegit3hub/seagull
```
