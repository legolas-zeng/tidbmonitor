# Seagull Configuration Page

Configuration page display the basic version and information of your docker daemon. You can know about your version of go, the kernel of your operation system and so on.

## Why We Care

With seagull, you can know these basic configuration of docker. But why should we care?

In fact, if you're able to run seagull, you must configurate and run docker well. So the current versions of kernel, go and docker are appropriate. But what if someone ask what's your execution driver or configuration of docker daemon? Actually you can get this information with `docker version` and `docker info`.

But seagull does it better. Just check your configuraion in your browser.
