# Seagull Dockerhub Page

Dockerhub page displays the images in official docker registry. You can search any image from docker hub in this page.

## Why We Need This

Now we can search images in dockerhub page of seagull or in command-line interface. But why do we need both of them?

I think seagul just helps to make it easy to search and view images in Web UI. It's not an important improvement but it actually works.

It would be better if we can download the images in this page. But the data from docker daemon is a stream so we have to think another way to handle it.
