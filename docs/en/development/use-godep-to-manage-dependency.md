# Use Godep To Manage Dependency

Godep is the tool to manage dependency of go. It solves the problem that seagull possibly doesn't work if the dependent Beego has updated.

## Official Tutorial

Here is the Github page of godep, <https://github.com/tools/godep>.

There's an example of usage and you can go to <http://www.goinggo.net/2013/10/manage-dependencies-with-godep.html>.

## How Seagull Uses It

Have you noticed the folder named Godeps? It's generated by godep and contains all the source code of my go dependency.

We simply run `godep save` and the current Beego project is downloaded in Godeps.

It makes sure that the current version of Beego is stable and it always works with `godep go build`.

Normally `go get` and `go build` works like a charm but we use `godep` for stability.
